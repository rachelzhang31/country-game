    <h1>Welcome to Rachel's Country Game!</h1>
    <p>This site is the result of countless hours wasted on <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/world">Sporcle's Country Quiz</a>. Since I currently hold the world record for all 197 countries named in 4 minutes and 11 seconds, I thought it would be nice to create a site for myself to practice speed runs without having to deal with Sporcle's server.</p>
